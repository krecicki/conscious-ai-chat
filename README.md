This combined script does the following:

It integrates the ConsciousMachine class into the chatbot.
For each user input, the chatbot:

Perceives the input using the ConsciousMachine's perceive method.
Updates the internal state of the ConsciousMachine.
Generates an introspection and a decision using the ConsciousMachine.


The chatbot includes the introspection and decision in the system message sent to GPT-3.5-turbo, allowing the model to incorporate this "conscious" state into its responses.
After each response, the chatbot displays its current internal state and decision.

This implementation creates a chatbot that simulates aspects of consciousness, including:

Short-term and long-term memory
Changing internal states (emotions and needs)
Attention and focus
Introspection
Decision-making based on internal state

The GPT-3.5-turbo model is then used to generate responses that are informed by this simulated conscious state, creating a more complex and dynamic interaction.
To use this script:

Make sure you have the OpenAI Python library installed (pip install openai).
Replace "your-api-key-here" with your actual OpenAI API key.
Run the script in your command prompt or terminal.

This implementation provides a interesting blend of rule-based AI (the ConsciousMachine) and large language model capabilities (GPT-3.5-turbo), creating a unique chatbot experience that simulates aspects of consciousness.
